# Dreambot
Some open source dreambot 4 script's i've been working on with AI 

PieShellProducer -  Buy's  pastry dough or pie dish from the GE and will make them.  Can load with supplies or it will buy doesn't do much just an example I made with AI 
 

Monk Disrober -  has some error but if you load it with coins it will purchase vile ashes and bury until 31 prayer then talk's to the monestary monk to get access to the top floor where it then picks monk robes, hops world's and banks when full. 

Gegroundpicker - Walks to the GE and picks items off the group needs better handling of item values as it will pick up everything  

Highalcher ( will high/low alch items in bank or will purchase items) doesnt detect when GE buying is already maxed out but its a working start. 


these are not my final scripts but stuff to get people started and examples!  

Script's using smartmouse   ( may not be working fully on some scripts  I am unsure) but it's been working in some final versions to help evade bans.
